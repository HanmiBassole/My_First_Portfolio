  <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello! This is my very first webpage created as part of my ALX Front-End journey. I'm excited to learn HTML and build amazing websites!</p>

  <h3>What This Page Contains</h3>
  <p>On this page, you'll see some basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, and a clickable image. It may look simple now, but it's a solid foundation!</p>

  <p>I’m learning to use proper structure and tags to organize content meaningfully on a webpage.</p>

  <p>As I progress, I’ll improve this portfolio with more sections and styling using CSS and JavaScript.</p>
